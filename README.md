# Calorie-Counter

WHO ARE THE USERS OF THE SOFTWARE?
- the users of the software can be anyone who wants to be counting calories for their own reasons such as wanting to see how much calories they intake to see if they need to eat more, less, or stay the same

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE SOFTWARE?
- the purpose of the software is to help people achieve their health goals and doing that is having a software that can help you track your calories

WHERE AND WHEN WILL THE SOFTWARE BE USED?
- this software would mainly be used on your phone as an app. After you eat you can search up what each item you consumed is and log them in on the go. I think an app would be more effective then a website because not everyone is going to remember to go on their computer and log for the day, instead they could just add it on their phone

HOW DOES THE SOFTWARE WORK?
- this software will ask the user to enter a name of the food/drink that you want to log along with the calories and it will add to a list to see how many calories you consumed for the day

WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO USE THIS SOFTWARE OVER AN EXISTING ONE?
- I think that having an option that is free would help a lot of people instead of paying a lot of money just to use some of the main functions of the software, having a free alternative I think would be enough to bring users over from other existing processes
